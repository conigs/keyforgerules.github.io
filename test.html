<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-crucible">WELCOME TO THE CRUCIBLE…</h2>

<p><em>You are an Archon. Hailed by some as a god, respected by others for
your wisdom, you were born—or perhaps created—on the Crucible, a
world in which anything is possible.</em></p>

<p>The Crucible is ancient, but ever renewed. An artificial planet hanging in
the center of the universe, the Crucible’s many layers remain constantly
under construction by the enigmatic and mischievous Architects. For raw
materials, the Architects have harvested countless worlds, blending them
into a new whole both familiar and alien to the creatures that dwell there.</p>

<p>Whether lone specimens or entire cultures, the beings brought to the
Crucible find themselves in a strange wonderland with no obvious means
of returning to their former homes. Some thrive, building new societies
and developing new technologies with the aid of the mysterious psychic
substance known as Æmber. Some discard the trappings of their old
lives, adopting the ways and customs of new tribes discovered in this new
world. Others devolve, bodies and minds twisted beyond all recognition,
incorporating Æmber into their very bodies.</p>

<p>As an Archon, you have gathered followers in your journeys throughout
the Crucible, allies who find value in your ageless wisdom and your
ability to speak to all creatures. With the aid of these allies, you seek
out Vaults hidden throughout the Crucible by the cryptic Architects.
Each Vault can only be unlocked by Æmber-forged keys. Once open, a
Vault’s contents—the power and knowledge of the Architects—can be
consumed by only a single Archon.
When two Archons discover a Vault, only one can gain its knowledge.
Only one can move one step closer to the secret of the Crucible…</p>

<h3 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>KeyForge is a two-player card game in which each player takes the role
of an Archon, and leads that Archon’s deck against their opponent.</p>

<p>A player’s deck represents a team that is attempting to gain Æmber and
forge keys. The first player to gather three keys is able to unlock a Vault
and win the game.</p>

<p>The defining feature of KeyForge is that no two decks are alike. This is
not a trading card game—you cannot craft a deck. Rather, each deck
must remain as it is. Every deck in existence is unique!</p>

<h2 id="using-this-document">USING THIS DOCUMENT</h2>

<p>If you have never played a game of KeyForge before, start by using the
Quickstart document included in the starter set to learn the basics of
the game.</p>

<p>After playing a game using the Quickstart, players can read the full rules
in this document and learn more about the KeyForge setting.</p>

<p>In addition to rules and setting information, this document includes a
Glossary of important game concepts and terminology that will be useful
while interpreting card abilities.</p>

<p><a name="rules"></a></p>

<h1 id="rules">RULES</h1>

<h3 id="key-concepts">KEY CONCEPTS</h3>

<p>This section introduces a number of foundational concepts to keep in
mind while playing the game.</p>

<h3 id="the-golden-rule">THE GOLDEN RULE</h3>

<p>If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of the rules, the text of
the card takes precedence.</p>

<h3 id="objective">OBJECTIVE</h3>

<p>During the game, players use their cards to collect Æmber. Players use
Æmber to forge keys. The game ends immediately when a player forges
their third key, and that player wins the game.</p>

<h3 id="ready-and-exhausted">READY AND EXHAUSTED</h3>

<p>Cards that are in play exist in one of two states.
Ready cards are oriented upright so that their text may be read from left
to right. A ready card can be used during a player’s turn, causing it to
exhaust.
Exhausted cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side. An exhausted card
is not able to be used until it is readied by a game step or card ability.
All creatures and artifacts enter play exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="running-out-of-tokens">RUNNING OUT OF TOKENS</h3>

<p>OR STATUS CARDS
There is no limit to the number of damage tokens, Æmber tokens, or
status cards that can be in the game area at a given time. If there is a
shortage of the provided tokens or status cards, other tokens, counters,
or coins may be used to track the game state.</p>

<h3 id="game-setup">GAME SETUP</h3>

<p>To set up the game, perform the following steps, in order:
1 Place all damage tokens, Æmber tokens, and status cards in a common
supply within easy reach of both players.
2 Each player places their identity card to the left or right side of their
play area.
3 Each player places three key tokens, one of each color, with the
unforged side faceup near their identity card.
4 Randomly determine who is the first player. That player takes the first
turn when the game begins. (If players are playing a series of games
between two decks, in each game after the first, the player who used
the deck that was defeated in the previous game chooses who is the
first player.)
5 Each player shuffles their deck and offers it to the opponent for
additional shuffling and/or a final cut.
6 The first player draws a starting hand of seven cards. The other player
draws a starting hand of six cards.
7 Each player, starting with the first player, has one opportunity to
mulligan their starting hand by shuffling it back into their deck and
drawing a new starting hand with one fewer card in it. (This step is
skipped in the Quickstart game.)
The game is now ready to begin.</p>

<h3 id="turn-sequence">TURN SEQUENCE</h3>

<p>The game is played over a series of turns. Players alternate taking turns
until one player wins the game.
Each turn consists of five steps:
1 Forge a key.
2 Choose a house.
3 Play, discard, and use cards of the chosen house.
4 Ready cards.
5 Draw cards.
The player taking a turn is referred to as the active player. The active
player is the only player that can perform actions or make decisions; a
player does not make any decisions when it is not their turn.
Each step is described in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-forge-a-key">STEP 1: FORGE A KEY</h3>

<p>If the active player has enough Æmber to forge a key during this step,
they must do so. To forge a key, the active player spends Æmber from
the Æmber pool on their identity card, returning it to the common
supply. Then, that player flips any one of their key tokens over to its
forged side, indicating that the key has been forged.
The default cost to forge a key is six Æmber. Some card abilities
may increase or decrease this number.
No more than one key can be forged during this step each turn, even
if the active player has enough Æmber to forge multiple keys.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-choose-a-house">STEP 2: CHOOSE A HOUSE</h3>

<p>Each KeyForge deck is composed of three different houses, which are
shown on the identity card. During this step, the active player chooses
one of those three houses to activate, making it the active house for
the remainder of the turn. This active house determines which cards the
active player can play, discard from their hand, and use this turn.
After choosing a house, the active player has the option to take all
cards in their archives and add them to their hand. (See “Archives” in
the Glossary.)
If a player controls a card that does not belong to one of the three
houses in their deck, they may (if they desire) choose and activate
that house during this step instead of one of the three houses in
their deck.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-play-discard-and-use-cards">STEP 3: PLAY, DISCARD, AND USE CARDS</h3>

<p>OF THE CHOSEN HOUSE
The active player may play or discard any number of cards of the active
house from their hand and may use any number of cards of the active
house that are in play under their control. Eligible cards may be played,
used, or discarded in any order.
A card’s house is determined by an icon in the
upper-left corner. If the active house corresponds
to a card’s icon, that card is eligible to be played,
used, or discarded.
Rules for playing, discarding, and using cards are
described later.
First Turn Rule: During the first player’s first
turn of the game, that player cannot play or
discard more than one card from their hand.
Card effects cannot modify this rule.
The active player may not play, use, or discard cards of other (nonactive) houses unless specified by a card ability</p>

<h3 id="step-4-ready-cards">STEP 4: READY CARDS</h3>

<p>The active player readies each of their exhausted cards.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-draw-cards">STEP 5: DRAW CARDS</h3>

<p>The active player draws cards from the top of their deck until they have
six cards in their hand. After a player completes this step, their turn ends.
If the active player has more than six cards in hand, they do not
discard down to six.
If a player needs to draw cards (during this step or at any other time)
and cannot because their deck is empty, that player shuffles their
discard pile to reset their deck, and then continues to draw.
When a player’s turn ends, if that player has enough Æmber in their
pool to afford a key, the player announces “Check!” so that their
opponent knows the forging of a key at the start of that player’s next
turn is imminent.</p>

<h3 id="playing-cards">PLAYING CARDS</h3>

<p>The active player is permitted to play any number of cards that belong to
the active house during step three of their turn.
ÆMBER BONUS
Many cards in the game have an Æmber bonus below the house icon.
When a card with an Æmber bonus is played, the first thing the active
player does is gain that much Æmber. Each time a player gains Æmber
(for any reason), the Æmber is placed in that player’s Æmber pool (on
their identity card).</p>

<h3 id="play-abilities">PLAY ABILITIES</h3>

<p>Some cards have a bold “Play:” ability. Such abilities resolve after the
card’s Æmber bonus is collected, if it has any, and immediately after the
card enters play.</p>

<h3 id="card-types">CARD TYPES</h3>

<p>There are four types of cards in the game: action cards, artifacts,
creatures, and upgrades. There are different rules describing how each
card type is played.</p>

<h3 id="action-cards">ACTION CARDS</h3>

<p>When an action card is played, the active
player resolves the card’s “Play:” ability
and, after resolving as much of the ability
as possible, places the card in their
discard pile.</p>

<h3 id="artifacts">ARTIFACTS</h3>

<p>Artifacts enter play exhausted and are
placed in a row in front of the player but
behind that player’s battleline, which is
explained on the next page. Artifacts
remain in play from turn to turn.</p>

<h3 id="creatures">CREATURES</h3>

<p>Creatures enter play exhausted and are placed in the front row of
the active player’s play area. This row is referred to as the battleline.
Creatures remain in play from turn to turn, and they each have
power and armor values that they use to resolve fights, which are
described later.</p>

<p>Each time a creature enters play, it must be placed on a flank—at the
far left or the far right of its controller’s battleline. Each time a creature
leaves play, shift the battleline inward to close the gap.</p>

<h3 id="upgrades">UPGRADES</h3>

<p>Upgrades enter play attached to (i.e., partially overlapped by) a creature
chosen by the player who controls the upgrade. Each upgrade remains in
play from turn to turn and modifies the card to which it is attached.
If the card to which an upgrade is attached leaves play, the upgrade
is discarded.
If an upgrade cannot attach to a card in play, the upgrade cannot
enter play.</p>

<h3 id="discarding-cards">DISCARDING CARDS</h3>

<p>The active player can discard from their hand any number of cards from
the active house during step three of their turn. Cards are discarded one
at a time, at any point throughout this step. This lets players remove
cards that they do not want to play from their hand, freeing up space to
draw more cards at the end of the turn.</p>

<h3 id="using-cards">USING CARDS</h3>

<p>The active player can use any number of cards from the active house that
they have in play during step three of their turn. Depending on a card’s
type, the active player is able to do different things when using that card.</p>

<h3 id="upgrades-1">UPGRADES</h3>

<p>An upgrade modifies the creature it is attached to and is not used
independently of that creature.</p>

<h3 id="using-artifacts">USING ARTIFACTS</h3>

<p>There are two types of abilities that enable a player to use an artifact:
“Action:” abilities and “Omni:” abilities.
When a player uses an artifact, they exhaust the card and then
resolve its abilities.
A player can only resolve an “Action:” ability if it is on a card that
belongs to the active house.
A player can resolve an “Omni:” ability even if it is on a card that
does not belong to the active house.
Some artifacts require that they be sacrificed as part of the cost of
using them. When an artifact is sacrificed, it is placed in its owner’s
discard pile. A player must still exhaust such an artifact when using it.
Artifacts cannot be used to reap or to fight.</p>

<h3 id="using-creatures">USING CREATURES</h3>

<p>When a player uses a creature, that player must exhaust the creature,
and the player has the option to reap, fight, or to trigger the creature’s
“Action:” ability.</p>

<h3 id="reap">REAP</h3>

<p>Any ready creature of the active house may reap. When a
creature is used to reap, its controller gains 1 Æmber for their Æmber
pool. Then, all “Reap:” abilities the creature has, if it has any, resolve.</p>

<h3 id="fight">FIGHT</h3>

<p>Any ready creature of the active house may fight. When a creature
is used to fight, its controller chooses one eligible creature controlled
by the opponent as the target of the attack. Each of the two creatures
deals an amount of damage equal to its power (the value to the left
of the card’s title) to the other creature. All of this damage is dealt
simultaneously. After the fight resolves, if the creature that is being
used to fight survives, all “Fight:” abilities the creature has, if it has
any, resolve.
A creature cannot fight if there is no enemy creature that can be
chosen as the target of the attack.</p>

<h3 id="action">ACTION</h3>

<p>Any ready creature of the active house may trigger its “Action:”
ability, if it has one. When a creature is used to trigger its “Action:”
ability, the creature exhausts and all “Action:” abilities the creature
has resolve.</p>

<h3 id="damage-and-armor">DAMAGE AND ARMOR</h3>

<p>When a creature is dealt damage, place an amount of damage tokens
equal to the amount of damage dealt on the creature. If a creature has as
much or more damage on it as it has power, the creature is destroyed and
placed on top of its owner’s discard pile. If a creature has an armor value
(to the right of the card’s title), the armor prevents that much incoming
damage each turn. (For more details, see “Armor” in the Glossary.)
When a creature leaves play, any Æmber on that creature is gained
by the opponent. (See “Capture” in the Glossary.)</p>

<h3 id="card-abilities">CARD ABILITIES</h3>

<p>When resolving a card ability, resolve as much of the ability as can be
resolved, and ignore the rest. Unless otherwise specified by the ability,
the active player makes all decisions while resolving an ability.
For details on specific terminology that can be found in card ability text,
see the Glossary.</p>

<h3 id="using-cards-via-other-card-abilities">USING CARDS VIA OTHER CARD ABILITIES</h3>

<p>If a card ability allows a player to play or use another card (or to fight or
to reap with a card), the chosen card may belong to any house unless the
ability specifically states otherwise.
When using a card via a card ability, any other requirements of using
the card (such as exhausting to reap, fight, or resolve its “Action:”
ability) must be observed, or the card cannot be used.
Players can only use cards they control, unless a card ability
specifically states otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-six">THE RULE OF SIX</h3>

<p>Occasionally, a situation may emerge in which, through a combination
of abilities, the same card may be played or used repeatedly during the
same turn. A player cannot play and/or use the same card and/or other
copies of that card (by title) more than six times during a given turn.</p>

<h3 id="constant-abilities">CONSTANT ABILITIES</h3>

<p>If a card has an ability that does not have a boldfaced precursor, the
ability is a constant ability that is active so long as the card remains in
play and meets all conditions specified by the ability.
Constant abilities on a card are active even while that card
is exhausted.
Applying the effects of a constant ability is not considered using a
card and therefore does not cause the card to exhaust.</p>

<h3 id="chains">CHAINS</h3>

<p>Chains represent supernatural bindings that are occasionally placed
onto specific Archons by the Architects: sometimes in an effort to better
challenge the Archon to grow and overcome greater adversity, and
other times to penalize the Archon for breaking a rule or a piece of
Crucible etiquette.
A player may gain chains through card abilities during a game. When
a player gains chains, that player increases their chain tracker by the
number of chains gained.
Each time (including during setup) a player with one or more chains would
draw one or more cards to refill their hand, that player draws fewer cards
(based on their current chain level, see below) and then sheds one chain
by reducing their chain tracker by one.
The more chains a player has, the greater the card penalty becomes.
Chains 1–6: draw 1 fewer card.
Chains 7–12: draw 2 fewer cards.
Chains 13–18: draw 3 fewer cards.
Chains 19–24: draw 4 fewer cards.
Example: Tori has been assigned seven chains. During setup, Tori will
draw two fewer cards and shed a chain. Then, the next six times Tori
refills her hand, she will draw up to five cards and shed another chain.
After all of her chains have been shed, Tori will draw to the standard
hand size.</p>

<h3 id="chain-handicaps-optional">CHAIN HANDICAPS (OPTIONAL)</h3>

<p>When playing a game between a weaker deck and a stronger
deck, players may use chains as a means to handicap the stronger
deck. Chains are used when players want a fair game between two
known decks rather than a potentially unfair competition between decks
that aren’t known. When playing with new decks, or competing in a
tournament, players will not use this handicap.</p>

<h3 id="suggestions-for-assigning-chains">SUGGESTIONS FOR ASSIGNING CHAINS</h3>

<p>When the players have a sense that a particular deck is stronger than
the opposing deck, start it with four chains. From then on, every time
the chained deck wins three games in a row against that opposing
deck, adjust the number of chains up by one, and if it loses three
games in a row, adjust the number of chains down by one.
As a player plays more games with their collection, the number of
chains assigned to a deck will fluctuate up and down based on the
matchup and how well the deck has performed against the opposing
deck.</p>

<h3 id="chain-bidding">CHAIN BIDDING</h3>

<p>If players are reasonably familiar with two decks they can ignore the
suggested number of chains, and instead bid a number of chains for
the right to use a particular deck.
Example: Terry and Julie decide to play Mother Mahospot against
Chancellor Fisher. Mother Mahospot is a deck that both players are
very familiar with, feel is quite strong, and enjoy playing. Chancellor
Fisher is a newer deck, that the players are not as comfortable
playing. The above guidelines suggest they begin with four chains
on Mother Mahospot. Julie looks at Fisher, considers a moment, and
says, “I’ll play Mother Mahospot at five.” Terry raises to six. Julie
goes to seven. Terry decides to let her play it at seven, and plays
Chancellor Fisher.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">WHAT’S NEXT</h3>

<p>You are now familiar with the basic rules of the game. The next section
of this book contains a Glossary of advanced concepts that can be
referenced while playing or interpreting card abilities.
An introduction to the KeyForge setting, with two short stories and
an introduction to each of the houses in the game, can be found on
page 13.</p>

<p><a name="glossary"></a></p>

<h1 id="glossary">GLOSSARY</h1>

<p>This Glossary includes a number of concepts and terms players may
encounter while playing the game, in alphabetical order. Instead of
reading this section from beginning to end, players are encouraged to
only look up new concepts as they are encountered during play.</p>

<h3 id="ability-card-ability">ABILITY, CARD ABILITY</h3>

<p>An ability is the special game text a card contributes to the game.
Unless an ability explicitly references an out-of-play area (such as a hand,
deck, archives, or discard pile), that ability can only interact with cards
that are in play.</p>

<h3 id="action-ability">ACTION ABILITY</h3>

<p>To use an “Action:” ability during their turn, the active player must
exhaust the card. The ability then resolves.</p>

<h3 id="active-house">ACTIVE HOUSE</h3>

<p>The active house is the house that the active player has chosen for the
current turn.</p>

<h3 id="active-player">ACTIVE PLAYER</h3>

<p>The active player is the player taking the current turn. The active player
makes all necessary decisions for all card abilities or timing conflicts that
need to resolve during their turn.
ÆMBER
Æmber is tracked by Æmber tokens, and is used to
forge keys.
See also: Capture, Keys, Reap, Steal.</p>

<h3 id="archives">ARCHIVES</h3>

<p>A player’s archives is a facedown game area in front of that player’s
identity card. Card abilities are the only means by which a player is
permitted to add cards to their archives. During step 2 of a player’s turn,
after they select an active house, the active player is permitted to pick up
all cards in their archives and add those cards to their hand.
Cards in a player’s archives are considered out of play.
A player may look at their archives at any time. A player is not permitted
to look at an opponent’s archives.
If the ability instructing a player to archive a card does not specify where
the card is archived from, the archived card comes from that player’s hand.</p>

<h3 id="armor">ARMOR</h3>

<p>Some creatures have an armor value to the right of the card title. Armor
prevents an amount of damage equal to the armor value that the creature
would take each turn. For example, if a creature has two armor and is dealt
one damage, that damage is absorbed by the armor, leaving the creature
with one armor for the rest of the turn. If the creature is later dealt three
more damage during that turn, one damage is absorbed and the other
two damage are dealt to that creature.
If a creature gains armor, the gains are additive and accumulate on top of
the creature’s printed armor value.
If a creature gains armor during a turn, the gained armor does not
absorb damage already dealt that turn. If a creature loses armor during
a turn, it is not retroactively dealt damage that was already absorbed by
the armor.
If a creature has a “~” symbol in its armor field, the creature has no
armor. Such creatures may gain armor through card effects.</p>

<h3 id="assault-x">ASSAULT (X)</h3>

<p>When a creature with the assault (X) keyword attacks, it deals damage
equal to its assault value (i.e., “X”) to the creature it is fighting before the
fight resolves. (The active player chooses whether this occurs before or
after other “Before Fight” effects and keywords.) If this damage destroys
the other creature, the rest of the fight does not occur.
If a creature with the assault (X) keyword gains another instance of the
assault (X) keyword, the two X values are added together.</p>

<h3 id="attack-attacker-attacking">ATTACK, ATTACKER, ATTACKING</h3>

<p>See “Fight” on page 10.</p>

<h3 id="battleline">BATTLELINE</h3>

<p>The battleline is the ordered line of creatures a player controls in play.
See “Creatures” on page 6.</p>

<h3 id="before">BEFORE</h3>

<p>If the word “before” is used in an ability (for example, “Before Reap:” or
“Before Fight:”), that ability resolves before resolving the game effect of
the reap or fight (but after the card exhausts, if exhausting is required to
use the card).</p>

<h3 id="capture">CAPTURE</h3>

<p>Captured Æmber is taken from an opponent’s Æmber pool and placed
on a creature controlled by the capturing player. Players may not spend
captured Æmber.
When a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is placed in
the opponent’s Æmber pool.
Unless otherwise specified, Æmber is placed on the creature that
captured it.</p>

<h3 id="chain-chains">CHAIN, CHAINS</h3>

<p>Some card abilities cause a player to gain one or more chains. If a player
gains chains, that player increases their chain tracker by the number of
chains gained.
If a player has at least one chain when refilling their hand and would
draw cards based on the number of remaining cards in their hand, they
draw fewer cards according to the chart below. Then, they shed one
chain by reducing the number on their chain tracker by one.
Chains 1-6: draw one fewer card.
Chains 7-12: draw two fewer cards.
Chains 13-18: draw three fewer cards.
Chains 19-24: draw four fewer cards.
See ”Chains” on page 8.</p>

<h3 id="control">CONTROL</h3>

<p>A player owns the cards that begin the game in their deck. When a card
enters play, it is under its owner’s control.
A player can take control of an opponent’s card. When this happens,
that card is placed in the new controller’s play area. If it is a creature, it is
placed on a flank of the new controller’s battleline.
If a player takes control of a card that belongs to a house not in the new
controller’s deck, they can make that house the active house during step
2 of their turn.
If a card that has changed control leaves play for any reason, it moves to
its owner’s appropriate out-of-play zone.</p>

<h3 id="cost-at-current-cost">COST, AT CURRENT COST</h3>

<p>The base cost to forge a key is six Æmber. This cost may be modified by
card abilities. The modified cost is referred to as the current cost.</p>

<h3 id="damage">DAMAGE</h3>

<p>Damage a creature has taken is tracked by placing damage tokens on
the creature. If a creature has an amount of damage on it equal to or
greater than its power, the creature is destroyed. Damage on a creature
does not reduce its power.
For more details on damage and combat, see page 7.</p>

<h3 id="destroyed">DESTROYED</h3>

<p>When a card is destroyed, it is placed in its owner’s discard pile.
If a card has a “Destroyed:” ability, the effect resolves automatically
when the card is destroyed, immediately before it leaves play.</p>

<h3 id="discard-pile">DISCARD PILE</h3>

<p>When a card is destroyed or discarded, it is placed on top of its owner’s
discard pile. The cards in each player’s discard pile are open information,
and may be referenced at any time.
The order of cards in a player’s discard pile is maintained during play,
unless a card ability causes this order to change.
When a player runs out of cards in their deck and are required to draw,
they shuffle their discard pile to create a new deck.</p>

<h3 id="elusive">ELUSIVE</h3>

<p>The first time a creature with the elusive keyword is attacked each turn, it
is dealt no damage and deals no damage to the attacker in the fight.
Elusive only stops damage that would be dealt by each creature’s power;
damage dealt by keywords or other abilities still applies.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-turn">END OF TURN</h3>

<p>End of turn effects are resolved when a player’s turn is over—after step 5,
the “Draw Cards” step.</p>

<h3 id="enemy">ENEMY</h3>

<p>If a card ability refers to an “enemy” game element, it refers to an
element currently controlled by the opponent.</p>

<h3 id="fight-1">FIGHT</h3>

<p>When a player uses a creature to fight, the player exhausts the creature
and chooses an opponent’s creature. Both creatures deal an amount of
damage equal to their power value to the opposing creature in the fight,
and both are “fighting” for the purposes of card effects.
A creature used to fight is said to be “attacking” and can be referred to
as “the attacker” during that fight.
If the attacker is not destroyed, all “Fight:” abilities on the attacking
creature then resolve. If either creature in a fight has a constant ability
referencing the end of the fight (example: “after an enemy creature is
destroyed fighting this creature…”), the creature must survive the fight to
resolve the ability. Only the attacker can trigger “Fight:” abilities.
“FIGHT WITH”
If an ability instructs a player to “fight with” or “ready and fight with”
a creature, the ability is granting the player permission to use the
designated creature to fight. The fight is resolved following the standard
rules for fighting, against a creature controlled by the opponent.</p>

<h3 id="flank">FLANK</h3>

<p>The creatures on the far right and far left of a player’s battleline are on
the flanks of the line. A creature in this position is referred to as a flank
creature. Any time a creature enters play or changes control, the active
player chooses which flank of its controller’s battleine it is placed on.</p>

<h3 id="forge">FORGE</h3>

<p>For details on forging keys, see page 4.</p>

<h3 id="friendly">FRIENDLY</h3>

<p>If a card ability refers to a “friendly” game element, it refers to an
element currently under the control of the same player.</p>

<h3 id="hazardous-x">HAZARDOUS (X)</h3>

<p>When a creature with the hazardous X keyword is attacked, it deals X
damage to the attacking creature before the fight resolves. (The active
player chooses whether this occurs before or after other “Before Fight”
effects and keywords.) If this damage destroys the other creature, the 
rest of the fight does not occur.
If a creature with the hazardous (X) keyword gains another instance of the
hazardous (X) keyword, the two X values are added together.</p>

<h3 id="heal">HEAL</h3>

<p>If an ability “heals” a creature, remove the specified amount of damage
from the creature.
If an ability “fully heals” a creature, remove all damage from the creature.</p>

<h3 id="house-choice">HOUSE CHOICE</h3>

<p>Each turn, a player must choose one of the three houses indicated by
their identity card, if able. Some card abilities may restrict a player’s
house choice.
If a player has gained control of a card that does not belong to one of
their three houses, that card’s house becomes an eligible choice for that
player while the player retains control of the card.
If there is no legal choice of house, the player plays the turn with no
active house.
If a player is faced with two (or more) “must choose” mandates, the
player may choose either of those options.
“IF YOU DO” AND “IN ORDER TO”
If an ability includes the phrase “if you do” or “in order to,” the player
referenced by the ability must successfully and completely resolve the
text that precedes that phrase before they can resolve or perform the
text that follows that phrase. In other words, if the first part of the ability
is not successfully and completely resolved, that which follows the phrase
does not resolve or cannot be performed.</p>

<h3 id="keys">KEYS</h3>

<p>The first player to forge all three of their keys immediately wins
the game.
The color of a key has no impact on the game. Future card abilities may
reference keys of a specific color.
For details on forging keys, see page 4.</p>

<h3 id="least-powerful">LEAST POWERFUL</h3>

<p>A reference to the “least powerful” creature refers to the creature in play
with the lowest power. If there are multiple creatures that qualify, each is
considered “least powerful.”
If an ability requires the selection of a single least powerful creature, and
multiple creatures are tied, the active player chooses one.</p>

<h3 id="leaves-play">LEAVES PLAY</h3>

<p>If a card that is in play leaves play (is returned to hand or deck,
destroyed, discarded, archived, or purged), all non-Æmber tokens and
status cards on the card are removed, all upgrades on the card are
discarded, and all lasting effects applied to the card expire.
If a creature with Æmber on it leaves play, the Æmber is placed in the
opponent’s Æmber pool. If a non-creature card with Æmber on it leaves
play, the Æmber is returned to the general token pool.
If a card has a “Leaves Play:” ability, the effect happens automatically
immediately before the card leaves play.</p>

<h3 id="maverick">MAVERICK</h3>

<p>This symbol indicates that a card is a maverick. A maverick
is an extremely rare instance of a card that has left its
standard house and is now a part of a new house. For all
game purposes, treat a maverick as belonging to the house
printed on its graphic template.</p>

<h3 id="may">MAY</h3>

<p>If an ability includes the word “may,” the text that follows “may” is
optional. If a player chooses to resolve a “may” ability, the player must
resolve as much of the ability as they are able.</p>

<h3 id="most-powerful">MOST POWERFUL</h3>

<p>A reference to the “most powerful” creature refers to the creature in play
with the highest power. If there are multiple creatures that qualify, each is
considered “most powerful.”
If an ability requires the selection of a single most powerful creature,
and multiple creatures are tied, the active player chooses among the
tied creatures.</p>

<h3 id="mulligan">MULLIGAN</h3>

<p>During setup, each player, starting with the first player, has one
opportunity to mulligan their starting hand. This is done by shuffling the
starting hand back into the deck and drawing a new starting hand with
one fewer card in it.
After a player chooses to mulligan, that player must keep the new
starting hand.</p>

<h3 id="neighbor">NEIGHBOR</h3>

<p>The creatures to the immediate left and right of a creature in a player’s
battleline are its neighbors.</p>

<h3 id="omni">OMNI</h3>

<p>The active player may trigger any ”Omni:“ abilities under their control
during any of their turns, even if the card with the ”Omni:“ ability does
not belong to the active house.</p>

<h3 id="off-house">OFF HOUSE</h3>

<p>An off house card is any card that belongs to a house that is not the
active house.</p>

<h3 id="opposing">OPPOSING</h3>

<p>When a creature is involved in a fight (either because it was used to fight,
or because it was attacked by another creature), the other creature in the
fight is the opposing creature.</p>

<h3 id="pay">PAY</h3>

<p>If a player must pay Æmber to an opponent, the Æmber is removed from
the paying player’s pool and added to the opponent’s pool.</p>

<h3 id="play">PLAY</h3>

<p>When a card has a “Play:” ability, the effect occurs any time the card
is played. For creatures, artifacts, and upgrades, the ability resolves
immediately after the card enters play. For action cards, the ability
resolves, and then the card is placed in its owner’s discard pile.
If an ability “plays” a card from a source other than hand, “Play:”
abilities on the card resolve. If an ability “puts” a card “into play,”
“Play:” abilities on the card do not resolve.</p>

<h3 id="poison">POISON</h3>

<p>Any damage dealt via the power of a creature with the poison keyword
during a fight destroys the damaged creature. This occurs when the
damage is successfully applied to the opposing creature.
Poison has no effect if all of the damage is absorbed by armor or
prevented by another ability—poison only resolves when one or more
damage is successfully dealt.
Poison refers only to damage that would be dealt by the creature’s
power, not by damage that is dealt by keywords or other card abilities.</p>

<h3 id="power-counter-1-power-status-card">POWER COUNTER +1, POWER STATUS CARD</h3>

<p>When a creature is given a “+1 power counter,” one such status card is
placed on the creature. For each of these cards that is on a creature, that
creature’s power is increased by one.</p>

<h3 id="preceding-repeat-the-preceding">PRECEDING, REPEAT THE PRECEDING</h3>

<p>If card text instructs players to repeat a preceding effect, the entirety
of the effect before the text providing the instruction to repeat resolves
again.
Note: Repeating an effect does not interact with the Rule of Six (see
page 7), as the Rule of Six only applies to playing or using cards, not
triggering their effect multiple times.</p>

<h3 id="purge">PURGE</h3>

<p>When a card is purged, it is removed from the game and placed
facedown beneath its owner’s identity card. Purged cards no longer
interact with the game state in any manner.</p>

<h3 id="rarity">RARITY</h3>

<p>A card’s rarity symbol can be found at the bottom of the card, near the
collector number. A card’s rarity (common, uncommon, rare, or special)
is used by the deck-generation algorithm to determine how frequently
it will appear in decks. Special cards have a different type of distribution
and do not obey the game’s standard rarity rules.</p>

<h3 id="reap-1">REAP</h3>

<p>When a player uses a creature to reap, the player exhausts the creature,
gains 1 Æmber for their Æmber pool, and then all “Reap:” abilities on
the creature resolve.</p>

<h3 id="repeat">REPEAT</h3>

<p>If card text instructs players to repeat an effect, the entirety of the effect
resolves again including the text to repeat the effect. If the card that
is creating a repeating effect is removed from play, the effect can no
longer repeat.
Note: Repeating an effect does not interact with the Rule of Six (see
page 7,) as the Rule of Six only applies to playing or using cards, not
triggering their effect multiple times.
See also “Preceding.”</p>

<h3 id="return">RETURN</h3>

<p>When captured Æmber is returned, it is placed in the opponent’s Æmber
pool.</p>

<h3 id="sacrifice">SACRIFICE</h3>

<p>When a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must discard
that card from play.
When a card is sacrificed, that card is considered to have been
destroyed, and any “Destroyed:” abilities the card has resolve.</p>

<h3 id="search">SEARCH</h3>

<p>When a player searches a game area (such as a deck), that player looks
at all the cards in the specified area without showing those cards to the
opponent. A player may choose to fail to find the object of a search.
If an entire deck is searched, the deck must be adequately shuffled upon
completion of the search.
If a discard pile is searched, the cards are kept in the same order.</p>

<h3 id="self-referential-text">SELF-REFERENTIAL TEXT</h3>

<p>If a card’s ability refers to its own title, that reference is only to itself and
not to other copies of the card.</p>

<h3 id="skirmish">SKIRMISH</h3>

<p>When a creature with the skirmish keyword is used to fight, it takes no
damage from the opposing creature when the damage from the fight
is dealt.
This applies only to damage that would be dealt by the opposing
creature’s power, not by damage that is dealt by keywords or other
card abilities.</p>

<h3 id="splash">SPLASH</h3>

<p>When an ability deals damage to a creature “with splash damage,” the
splash damage is dealt to each of the target creature’s neighbors.</p>

<h3 id="steal">STEAL</h3>

<p>When an ability steals Æmber, the stolen Æmber is removed from the
opponent’s Æmber pool and added to the Æmber pool of the player
resolving the steal ability.
If an ability steals more Æmber than a player has remaining in their pool,
the ability steals only the amount remaining in the pool.</p>

<h3 id="stun-stun-status-card">STUN, STUN STATUS CARD</h3>

<p>When a creature becomes stunned, place a stun status card on it. The
next time the creature is used, the only thing that happens is the creature
exhausts and the stun card is removed. It does not reap or fight, and any
“Reap:,” “Fight:,” or “Action:” abilities on the creature do not resolve.
Constant abilities and abilities that do not require the creature to reap,
fight, or be used are still active.
If a stunned creature is attacked, it still deals damage to the attacking
creature during the fight.
While a creature is stunned, it cannot become stunned again.</p>

<h3 id="swap">SWAP</h3>

<p>If two game elements are swapped, they exchange places with
one another.
When two creatures are swapped, they exchange positions. This means
that each takes the position in the battleline of the other. The two
creatures swapped must always be controlled by the same player.
If cards from two distinct game areas are swapped (such as a card in play
and a card in hand), the cards switch game areas.</p>

<h3 id="taunt">TAUNT</h3>

<p>If a creature has the taunt keyword, any of its neighbors that do not
have the taunt keyword cannot be attacked by an enemy creature that is
being used to fight.
In the battleline, taunt creatures are slid slightly forward to indicate their 
presence to the opponent.
“THIS WAY”
If an ability refers to an effect that occurred “this way,” it is referring to
an effect that was produced by the same resolution of that same ability.</p>

<h3 id="turn">TURN</h3>

<p>A turn consists of one player performing the five steps detailed in the
game’s turn sequence, which are:
1 Forge a key.
2 Choose a house.
3 Play, discard, and use cards of the chosen house.
4 Ready cards.
5 Draw cards.</p>

<h3 id="traits">TRAITS</h3>

<p>Traits are descriptive attributes (such as “Knight” or “Specter”) that may
be referenced by other cards. Traits are listed at the top center of a card’s
text box.
Traits have no inherent game effect, but may be referenced by
card abilities.</p>

<h3 id="unforge">UNFORGE</h3>

<p>If a previously forged key is “unforged,” flip the key token to its unforged
side. The key no longer counts toward its controller’s victory condition
and must be forged again to win the game.</p>

<h3 id="use">USE</h3>

<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<p>This section provides answers to a number of common questions that
are asked about the game. These questions are presented in a “Question and Answer” format, with the newest questions at the end.</p>

<p>My opponent has 14 Æmber in their pool and I have 0 in mine. At
the start of my turn I select Shadows as the active house and play
the card Bait and Switch (CoTA 267). How many times does Bait
and Switch trigger?</p>

<p>In this situation, Bait and Switch’s effect will be triggered 7 times. Each
time the effect is triggered it will check if your opponent still has more
Æmber than you, and if they do it will trigger again. So after the first
time the effect triggers you will have 1 Æmber and your opponent will
have 13, the second time you will have 2 Æmber and your opponent
will have 12, then 3 and 11, 4 and 10, 5 and 9, 6 and 8, then finally 7 and</p>
<ol>
  <li>Once both players have the same amount of Æmber when the effect
checks if your opponent has more Æmber than you the effect will see
that your opponent does not and the card effect will not trigger again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Repeating an effect does not interact with the Rule of Six (see
page 7), as the Rule of Six only applies to playing or using cards, not
triggering their effect multiple times.</p>

<p>Its the first turn of the game and I am going first. I choose house
Logos to be the active house and play the card Phase Shift (CoTA
117). Does this allow me to play another card this turn even though
the First Turn Rule (see page 5) is in effect?</p>

<p>Playing Phase Shift will not allow you to play any more cards from
your hand this turn, since the First Turn Rule cannot be modified by
card effects.</p>

<p>Its the first turn of the game and I am going first. I choose house
Logos to be the active house and play the card Wild Wormhole
(CoTA 125). Can Wild Wormhole’s effect be resolved even though
the First Turn Rule (see page 5) is in effect?</p>

<p>Wild Wormhole’s effect can be resolved. The First Turn Rule specifies
that players cannot play or discard more than one card from their hand.
However it does not prohibit cards from being played or discarded
from other game areas, such as your deck.</p>

<p>I have 2 chains and 7 cards in hand when moving to my draw cards
step. Will I shed a chain during this step?</p>

<p>No, you will not shed a chain during this draw cards step. Chains are
only shed when a player would draw cards during the draw step and
the chains prevent them from doing so (see “Chains” on Page 8). Since
you already have 7 cards in your hand, you aren’t going to be drawing
any cards, and thus don’t lose any of your chains.</p>

<p>I have 2 chains and 5 cards in hand when moving to my draw cards
step. Will I shed a chain during this step?</p>

<p>Yes, you will shed a chain during this step. Chains are only shed when a
player would draw cards during the draw step and the chains prevent
them from doing so (see “Chains” on Page 8). You only have 5 cards in
hand, and normally you would draw a card to refill your hand. However
because of the chains you are prevented from drawing that card. Since
you would normally have drawn the card and the chain prevented it,
you then shed 1 chain.</p>

<p>I have a creature that has the card Biomatrix Backup (CoTA 208)
attached. Its my opponent’s turn and they use one of their creatures to attack and destroy my creature. What happens?</p>

<p>Since it is your opponent’s turn and they are the active player, they will
get to make all decisions for all cards. In this case Biomatx Backup has
the word “may”, meaning that the effect is optional. Thus if your creature
is destroyed with the upgrade on it during your opponent’s turn, your
opponent will decide whether the card is put into your archives or not.</p>

<p>I have the card Pitlord (CoTA 093) in play and my opponent plays
the card Restringuntus (CoTA 094) and chooses house Dis. What
happens when I go to declare my house on my next turn?</p>

<p>On your next turn during the choose a house step of your turn you
will be in a position where you must choose house Dis because of the
Pitlord, but also cannot choose house Dis because of the Restringuntus.
In this case no house is a legal option to be your active house and you
must declare no house as your active house (see “House Choice” on
Page 10.)</p>

<p>I have chosen house Logos to be my active house this turn and
start off by playing Library Access (CoTA 115), I then play Wild
Wormhole (CoTA 125). In what order do I resolve this combination
of effects?</p>

<p>When you play a Wild Wormhole after playing a Library Access the
following happens in this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You gain 1 Æmber from Wild Wormhole’s Æmber bonus.</li>
  <li>You draw a card from Library Access’s effect.</li>
  <li>You resolve Wild Wormhole’s effect and play the top card of
your deck.</li>
  <li>You gain Æmber from any Æmber bonus on the played card.</li>
  <li>You draw a card from Library Access’s effect.</li>
  <li>You resolve any play effects on the card played from the top of
your deck.</li>
</ol>
